# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

User Roles:

1. Patient: Can view medical history, prescriptions, and upcoming appointments.

2. Doctor: Can manage patient records, view medical history, and issue prescriptions.

3. Pharmacist: Can access prescriptions based on a patient’s national ID and dispense medications accordingly.

Objective: The goal of EasyCare is to enhance the quality of healthcare by reducing manual errors, ensuring data integrity, and providing a centralized platform for all healthcare stakeholders.
